# robofriends

This app will display the robot images from https://robohash.org/. In search box, if you enter the name, it will display a specific robot image.

To get a link of an image from Robohash's website, I use Robohash API to get it. You just enter any string or character after the main url.
For example: https://robohash.org/myfirstrobot

The components will be included App.js, CardList.js, SearchBox.js, and Card.js.

Initate React app:
npm install -g create-react-app

Create React app:
create-react-app 'Appname'

cd 'Appname'

To start React app:
npm start
